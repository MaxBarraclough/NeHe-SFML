- Fix keyboard event-handling. SFML provides a proper solution for this: isKeyPressed
  Remaining now: Lesson 12.

- Implement does-file-exist checks for *all* file operations.
  (SFML falls back to white polygons if it fails to open image files; we would be better off exiting.)

- Port the rest of the lessons. (Currently we have only the first 12.)

- Fix repetitive vsync configuration adjustment, see http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=4481.msg29255#msg29255

- Is everything ok regarding Z-buffer, or whichever hidden-region-elimination (TODO: what are these called again?) algo we're going with? Things look funny... maybe this is actually all fine? Lesson 7 certainly doesn't look right... is that intentional?

- Cruft-removal: delete any stray commented-out code

- Go through anywhere in the code where the string "TODO" appears

- Port the non-lesson cpp files

- Add a COPYING file (or copying.txt), and reintroduce the requirement for it in CMakeLists.txt

- Not sure how to do this regarding resource files, but we could do a more 'proper' installation procedure.
  See http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake_tutorial.html :: "Installing and Testing (Step 3)"
  This would probably mean changes to source: we couldn't just open "data/world.txt". Presumably CPack has a way of handling this stuff somehow.
